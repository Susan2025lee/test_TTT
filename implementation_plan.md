# Tic Tac Toe Agent System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for developing an AI agent system to play Tic Tac Toe, including memory systems and reward functions.

## Core Components

### 1. Game Environment
#### Board Representation
- 3x3 numpy array representation (0: empty, 1: X, -1: O)
- Move validation system
- Legal move generator
- State representation

#### State Management
- Current player tracking
- Game history maintenance
- Turn transition handling
- Game state validation

#### Game Rules
- Win condition detection (8 patterns)
- Draw condition checking
- Move validity verification
- Game termination handling

### 2. Memory System
#### Short-term Memory
- Current game sequence storage
- Board state history
- Immediate context tracking
- Move sequence recording

#### Experience Memory
- Complete game storage
- Outcome tracking
- Pattern indexing
- Priority-based storage system

#### Strategic Memory
- Winning pattern storage
- Successful sequence tracking
- Opening move statistics
- Counter-move patterns

### 3. Reward System
#### Immediate Rewards
- Position-based rewards
  - Center: 0.4
  - Corners: 0.3
  - Edges: 0.2
- Tactical rewards
